## Description
<p>An application designed to allow neurodivergent users to create and share their communication plan with others to foster positive social interactions, especially with those who may be unaware of their needs. The goal is to create better individual experiences and ease anxiety for our users through a "communication passport" that can be shared with others using a unique ID or QR code which describes basic information such as the users' disability, communication needs (giving extra time to process, avoiding overcomplicated questions, trigger words to avoid, topics not to be discussed, etc) and contact information for a trusted person if extra support is needed.</p>
