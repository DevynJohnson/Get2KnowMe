# Get2KnowMe

A web application designed to empower neurodivergent individuals by providing them with a digital platform to create and share their communication needs and preferences with others.

## Description

Get2KnowMe is a comprehensive communication passport application that enables users to create personalized profiles containing their communication preferences, support needs, and trusted contact information. This innovative solution helps foster positive social interactions by providing essential information to third parties who may be unaware of specific communication needs or accommodations for individuals, especially those in the neurodivergent community.
