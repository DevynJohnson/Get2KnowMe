# Get2KnowMe [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A web application designed to empower neurodivergent individuals by providing them with a digital platform to create and share their communication needs and preferences with others.

## Description

Get2KnowMe is made for being understood and its purpose is to help people be seen for who they are - not just their diagnosis.

Together we can make communication fairer, kinder, and more human. Get2KnowMe provides a simple and secure platform that helps people communicate their needs, preferences, and personality - especially when words are difficult to find.

It's designed for neurodivergent individuals, people with communication differences, or anybody who wants to be better understood.

With Get2KnowMe, you can create a Digital Communication Passport: a personalized profile that explains how you communicate, any adaptations or accommodations you need, and what support is helpful for you, as well as the things that make you feel safe, seen and heard.

Each passport comes with a unique QR code, allowing you to easily share your information with teachers, healthcare workers, emergency workers, employers, caregivers, friends, or anyone you meet.

## GDPR & Privacy Compliance

Get2KnowMe is committed to protecting user privacy and complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant privacy laws. Our comprehensive privacy framework includes:

### Legal Compliance
- **Explicit Consent**: Users must provide explicit consent to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy during registration, including age confirmation and agreement to data processing.
- **Right of Access & Deletion**: Users can access, export, or delete their data at any time via the application interface or by contacting support.
- **Data Portability**: Full data export functionality allows users to download their information in a structured format.
- **Breach Notification**: Users will be notified promptly in the event of a data breach affecting their personal data.

### Privacy by Design
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential information is collected for account creation and communication passport functionality. No unnecessary or sensitive data is collected beyond what is required for the service.
- **User Search Privacy**: User Search is designed for privacy - searching for users requires a full username, a valid passcode, or scanning a QR code. Partial matches are not allowed, and users can opt out of appearing in search results entirely. This helps ensure that only those with explicit information can find a user profile.
- **Social Privacy Controls**: Users can toggle on/off their ability to appear in search results and whether they can receive follow requests, directly from their Profile Settings. This gives users full control over their discoverability and social interactions.

### Data Security & Protection
- **Database Encryption**: Personally identifiable information (PII) is encrypted at the field level in MongoDB using [mongoose-field-encryption](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-field-encryption), ensuring sensitive data is protected at rest.
- **Transport Security**: All data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS with strict security headers.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt with industry-standard salt rounds.
- **Session Security**: Secure session management with MongoDB-backed storage and proper cookie security.
- **Access Controls**: Passport data is only visible when a user chooses to share their passcode or QR code.

### Technical Privacy Measures
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limits prevent abuse and protect against brute force attacks.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent data corruption and security vulnerabilities.
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging system tracks security events and data access patterns while respecting user privacy.
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers prevent unauthorized data exfiltration and protect against XSS attacks.

### Children's Privacy & Parental Consent
The platform restricts use to those 16+ (or 13+ in the UK) unless verifiable parental consent is provided, in line with GDPR and UK GDPR requirements. For underage users:
- No personal data is stored until a parent or guardian provides explicit consent via a secure, tokenized email workflow
- All pending registration data is encrypted at rest using field-level encryption (email, username, and password)
- The parent receives a unique consent link, and only upon their approval is the child's account created and data stored
- If consent is declined, all pending data is securely deleted
- If consent is neither granted nor denied, temporary registration data is automatically deleted after 24 hours

### Data Processing & Storage
- **Data Hosting**: Data is stored securely using Render and MongoDB Atlas, both of which provide strong security and compliance features.
- **Third-Party Processors**: Only reputable, GDPR-compliant third-party services are used for hosting and infrastructure. No user data is sold or shared for marketing purposes.
- **Data Retention**: Clear data retention policies ensure information is not kept longer than necessary.
- **Geographic Compliance**: Data processing complies with both EU GDPR and UK GDPR requirements.

### User Rights & Transparency
- **Privacy Policy & Terms**: Full Privacy Policy and Terms of Service are available in the app and repository, outlining user rights and data practices.
- **Transparency Reports**: Regular updates on data processing activities and compliance measures.
- **User Control**: Granular privacy controls allow users to manage their data visibility and social interactions.

For any privacy-related requests or questions, users can contact the team at [enquiries@get2knowme.co.uk].
